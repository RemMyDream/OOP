1. Problem 2.2.5 (P225.java)
java.util.Scanner allows users to input the data
sc.nextLine(): Input the data as String
We use Double.parseDouble(): Convert String to double data type
In conditional command:
+ if num2 == 0, print "ERROR"
+ else calculate the answer of this calculation

2. Problem 2.2.6 (P226.java)
In this problem, we use queries that when user type String, the console return the solution:
For example, if users type First-degree equation with one variable (fde1) and input the coeffiecients of the equation, the console will print the solution of fde1.
In this code, we use 3 method fde1, fde2, sde to solve each problem respectively and consider all possibility of the value of the coeffiecients

3. Problem 6.1 (ChoosingOption.java)
- What happens if users choose “Cancel”? -> System will print "You've chosen: No" because in the coditional command if the users don't choose Yes, it will return No
- How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do” and “I don’t”:
-> Use JOptionPane.showOptionDialog instead of JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog and change the Options value to new Object[]{"I do", "I dont"}

4. InputFromKeyboard.java

5. Problem 6.3 (P63.java)
First, the user input the number of rows
for each line i (0 < i < n), the console will print " " (n-i-1) times and print (*) (2*i+1) times

6. Calculate Day (Day.java)
We need to input the value of year and month by Scanner and while to ensure that the format of input is valid
The converMonth method will ensure that the month has a valid format: 
- if format of input is digit, it will check if the value is in range [1,12]
- if the user input String, it will check whether that String is in String [] monthNames and equal abbreviation or shortname
Final
According to the given table, we can print the number of days

7. Problem 6.4 (Array.java)
We use BubbleSort to sort the Array

8. Problem 6.6 (AddMatrices.java)
Basically, we use loop for inputing and adding the element of two arrays
